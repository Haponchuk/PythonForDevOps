# 3-8. Seeing the World: Think of at least five places in the world you’d like to
# visit.
# • Store the locations in a list. Make sure the list is not in alphabetical order.
# • Print your list in its original order. Don’t worry about printing the list neatly,
# just print it as a raw Python list.
# • Use sorted() to print your list in alphabetical order without modifying the
# actual list.
# • Show that your list is still in its original order by printing it.
# • Use sorted() to print your list in reverse alphabetical order without chang-
# ing the order of the original list.
# • Show that your list is still in its original order by printing it again.
# • Use reverse() to change the order of your list. Print the list to show that its
# order has changed.
# • Use reverse() to change the order of your list again. Print the list to show
# it’s back to its original order.
# • Use sort() to change your list so it’s stored in alphabetical order. Print the
# list to show that its order has been changed.
# • Use sort() to change your list so it’s stored in reverse alphabetical order.
# Print the list to show that its order has changed.

# 3-9. Dinner Guests: Working with one of the programs from Exercises 3-4
# through 3-7 (page 42), use len() to print a message indicating the number
# of people you are inviting to dinner.

# 3-10. Every Function: Think of something you could store in a list. For example,
# you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or any-
# thing else you’d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items
# and then uses each function introduced in this chapter at least once.
