# 3-1. Names: Store the names of a few of your friends in a list called names. Print
# each person’s name by accessing each element in the list, one at a time.

# 3-2. Greetings: Start with the list you used in Exercise 3-1, but instead of just
# printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each mes-
# sage should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the
# person’s name.

# 3-3. Your Own List: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a
# motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list
# to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a
# Honda motorcycle.”
