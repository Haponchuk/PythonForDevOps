# Python for DevOps Learning Journey

## Introduction
I have embarked on a journey to learn Python with the ultimate goal of using it effectively in my DevOps career. Initially, I started learning Python using the book **"Python Crash Course"**, working through Chapters 2 and 3. However, I later decided to move away from strictly following the book and instead created my own roadmap tailored to the topics most relevant to DevOps.

This repository is a collection of solved tasks and organized notes that reflect my learning process and progress.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into folders that represent key learning stages and topics. Here is the structure:

### **1. Core Basics**
- Contains foundational Python concepts such as variables, data types, lists, conditions, functions, and loops.
- Includes subfolders:
  - **`chapter_02`**: Tasks and exercises from Chapter 2 of "Python Crash Course."
  - **`chapter_03`**: Tasks and exercises from Chapter 3 of "Python Crash Course."
  - **`conditions(if,else)`**: Tasks related to conditional statements.
  - **`functions`**: Tasks focused on creating and using functions.
  - **`loops`**: Tasks related to `for` and `while` loops.
  - **`final_tasks`**: Advanced tasks to consolidate the basics.

### **2. Advanced Data Structures**
- Topics will include dictionaries, tuples, sets, and comprehensions.

### **3. File Handling and Exceptions**
- Will be Tasks involving file operations (e.g., reading, writing) and handling exceptions gracefully.

### **4. Modules and Libraries**
- Topics will include importing built-in modules and working with third-party libraries like `os`, `sys`, `argparse`, and `subprocess`.

### **5. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- Will include Tasks covering the fundamentals of classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and more.

## Why This Structure?
While the initial folders (**`chapter_02`** and **`chapter_03`**) were created during my time with "Python Crash Course," the remaining folders were added as part of my customized learning roadmap. This roadmap allows me to focus on specific topics and practical tasks relevant to my DevOps goals.

## How to Use This Repository
1. Navigate to the folder that corresponds to the topic you want to explore.
2. Each folder contains Python scripts for solved tasks, named descriptively to reflect their purpose.
3. For example:
   - **`functions/average_of_args.py`**: Demonstrates calculating the average of arguments passed to a function.
   - **`loops/countdown_from_10.py`**: Implements a countdown using a `while` loop.
4. Use the scripts as learning resources or for practice by running and modifying the code.

## Future Plans
- Continue adding new tasks and topics to expand my knowledge.
- Explore Python libraries like `paramiko`, `boto3`, and `requests` to integrate Python with real-world DevOps tools and processes.
- Focus on automation scripts, monitoring, and CI/CD pipelines.
